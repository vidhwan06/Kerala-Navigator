It served as a crucial navigational aid when Alappuzha was among India’s busiest ports for spices, coir, and marine commodities. The structure stands at 30 meters in height and offers an observation deck with 360-degree views of the beach, coastline, and the bustling town. The lighthouse has been preserved as a heritage landmark and remains a key tourist attraction."
