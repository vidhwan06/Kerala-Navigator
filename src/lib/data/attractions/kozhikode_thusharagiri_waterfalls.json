The beach still retains old pier pillars that once supported cargo transfer to ships offshore. Over time, the area developed into a central recreational spot with a promenade, children's park, food stalls, and a lighthouse nearby. Today, it is one of the most visited places in Kozhikode city for both locals and tourists, especially in the evenings."
