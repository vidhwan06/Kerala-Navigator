    "short_description": "An ancient Vishnu temple where the deity is worshipped in the reclining posture on serpent Anantha (Adi Sesha), historically associated with the Travancore royal family.",
    "detailed": "Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple is one of the most revered temples in South India, dedicated to Lord Vishnu in the reclining posture on the serpent Anantha (Adi Sesha). The origins of the temple are considered to be lost in antiquity, with references found in ancient texts and traditions. In 1750, Maharaja Marthanda Varma of Travancore dedicated his kingdom to Lord Padmanabha, ruling thereafter as the 'Padmanabha Dasa' (servant of the Lord). The temple is built in a blend of Kerala and Dravidian architectural styles, with an impressive gopuram, intricate stone and wood carvings, and a sacred tank. It gained worldwide attention in recent years when its underground vaults were opened, revealing an enormous collection of treasures and artifacts."
