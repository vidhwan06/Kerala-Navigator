For centuries, farmers built protective earthen bunds and reclaimed vast tracts of land from Vembanad Lake to cultivate rice. These ‘padasekharams’ (paddy fields) represent Kerala’s most unique agricultural engineering tradition. Kuttanad’s villages—Kainakary, Nedumudi, Ramankary, Pulinkunnu—are interconnected by narrow canals, making boats the primary mode of transport. The region played a major role in Kerala’s agrarian economy, as well as its backwater tourism development."
