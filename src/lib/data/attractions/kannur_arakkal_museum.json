The Arakkal dynasty ruled parts of the Malabar coast and the Lakshadweep Islands for centuries, with strong influence over maritime trade. The museum displays royal artifacts including furniture, weapons, documents, coins, letters, household items, and intricate wooden architecture. The building reflects Kerala–Arab cultural influences. The Government of Kerala converted a section of the palace into a museum to preserve the royal family's history and maritime heritage."
