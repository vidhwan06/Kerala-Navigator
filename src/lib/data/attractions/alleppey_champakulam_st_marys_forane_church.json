Tradition links its origin to AD 52, when St. Thomas the Apostle arrived in Kerala and established early Christian communities. The current church structure is several centuries old and displays a mix of Syrian Christian, Portuguese, and Kerala architectural styles. The church is an important center for the Syro-Malabar Catholic community and houses ancient artifacts, manuscripts, rock inscriptions, and beautifully carved wooden ceilings. The church is also associated with the famous Champakulam Moolam Boat Race, one of Kerala’s oldest vallamkali (snake-boat) races."
