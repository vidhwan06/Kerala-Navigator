The name \u0027Meenmutty\u0027 comes from the Malayalam words \u0027Meen\u0027 (fish) and \u0027Mutty\u0027 (blocked), meaning a place where fish cannot reach. The waterfall is accessible only through a guided forest trek of about 1–1.5 km. Located near Banasura Sagar Dam, the falls form part of the Western Ghats ecosystem, known for dense forests, rich flora, and hilly terrain. Safety precautions are strict due to strong currents and slippery rocks."
