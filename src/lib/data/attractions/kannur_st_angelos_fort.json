    "short_description": "A 16th-century Portuguese fort built in 1505, later controlled by the Dutch and British, offering scenic sea views and historical architecture.",
    "detailed": "St. Angelo's Fort, also known as Kannur Fort, was constructed in 1505 by Dom Francisco de Almeida, the first Portuguese Viceroy of India. Due to its strategic coastal location, the fort played a major role in colonial military history. It was captured by the Dutch in 1663, who renovated the fortifications and added massive bastions. In the late 18th century, the fort came under British control. The fort features triangular bastions, thick laterite walls, secret tunnels, old barracks, and a panoramic view of the Arabian Sea. Today, it is maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India and stands as one of Kerala's most significant heritage forts."
