Historically, kettuvallams (houseboats) were used as cargo boats to transport rice and spices from Kuttanad’s paddy fields to coastal ports. With the arrival of modern transport, many of these boats were converted into houseboats for tourism, fitted with bedrooms, kitchens, and lounges. Today, Alleppey’s backwaters and houseboats are one of India’s most famous travel experiences, offering close views of village life, coconut groves, canals, and paddy fields lying below sea level."
