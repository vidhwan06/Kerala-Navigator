The caves contain petroglyphs (rock engravings) believed to be 6,000–10,000 years old, dating back to the Stone Age. These carvings depict human figures, weapons, animals, symbols, and scripts, showcasing early human civilization in South India. The caves were discovered by British officer Fred Fawcett in 1890, who classified the area as a prehistoric human settlement. Edakkal is the only place in South India with such Stone Age carvings, making it an important archaeological site."
