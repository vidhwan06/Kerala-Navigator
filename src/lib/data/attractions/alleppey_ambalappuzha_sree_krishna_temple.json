It is dedicated to Lord Krishna in his Parthasarathi form (charioteer to Arjuna). According to legend, during Tipu Sultan’s raids in 1789, the idol of Guruvayur’s Krishna was brought here for safety. The famous Pal Payasam (milk-rice pudding) offering began as a pledge to serve daily until a royal debt could be repaid, and continues to this day."
