Historically, the region was used as a meditation and retreat area due to its isolation and calm surroundings. Over the years, the island became a popular eco-tourism spot, famous for its rocky shores, dense coconut groves, and shallow waters. During low tide, visitors can walk through the exposed seabed to reach the island — a unique experience that draws tourists and photographers."
