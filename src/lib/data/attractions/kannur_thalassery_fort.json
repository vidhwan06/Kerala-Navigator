        "short_description": "Built by the British in 1708, Thalassery Fort played a major role in trade, military operations, and early colonial administration in North Kerala.",
        "detailed": "Thalassery Fort was constructed by the British East India Company in 1708 to consolidate their rule over the Malabar region and to protect their trade routes. Strategically located on a rocky promontory facing the Arabian Sea, the fort was crucial during conflicts with local rulers like the Kurichiya tribes and Tipu Sultan. The fort features massive laterite walls, hidden tunnels, secret chambers, and wide courtyards. It also served as a judicial and administrative center. The famous Thalassery Sea Bridge nearby once connected the fort to a trade harbor. Today, the Archaeological Survey of India preserves it as a protected monument."
