It once hosted the Madayi Kotta fort and an ancient watchtower. The hill is also home to inscriptions, old reservoirs, and the centuries-old Vadukunnu Temple. Over time, Madayipara became famous as a biodiversity hotspot with more than 500+ plant species, including rare orchids and seasonal wildflowers. The landscape changes color each season — green in monsoon, blue/purple in post-monsoon flowers, and golden in summer. It also serves as a prime spot for birdwatching and photography."
