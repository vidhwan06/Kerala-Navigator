Historically, the region was used by local tribes for grazing and as a pathway to Kodagu. Over time, it evolved into a popular trekking and nature tourism destination due to its vast grasslands, seasonal flowers, and panoramic valley views. The old Paithalmala watchtower offers spectacular views of the entire Western Ghat ranges and is a key attraction."
