The temple is distinctive because it follows traditions deeply rooted in Theyyam worship — a ritual art form combining dance, folklore, and devotion. According to legend, Muthappan appeared as a divine hunter who blessed people with food and protection. The temple practices include offering toddy, fish, and meat — uncommon in typical Hindu temples. Theyyam is performed every morning and evening, attracting devotees from across Kerala. The temple sits on the banks of the Valapattanam River, enhancing its spiritual ambiance."
