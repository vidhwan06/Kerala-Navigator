Located in the Western Ghats, it became a tourism hotspot due to its misty hills, tropical forests, and access to trekking routes, particularly Agasthyakoodam. The region is ecologically important because it forms part of the Agasthyamala Biosphere Reserve, a UNESCO site. Over the decades, Ponmudi developed into a popular weekend getaway for visitors from Thiruvananthapuram and other South Indian cities."
